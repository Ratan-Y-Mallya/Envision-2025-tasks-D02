# Task: Build a Basic Keypad Lock System with 16x2 LCD and Arduino

## Question Statement
Develop a **Keypad Lock System** using **Arduino, a 16x2 LCD display, and an LED indication system**. The system should perform the following tasks:

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Password Input:** Users should enter a password using a **4x4 Keypad**.
2. **LCD Display:**
   - Display "Enter Password:" when waiting for input.
   - Display "Access Granted" on correct password entry.
   - Display "Access Denied" on incorrect password entry.
3. **LED Indication:**
   - **Green LED** glows when the correct password is entered.
   - **Red LED** glows when an incorrect password is entered.
4. **Reset Mechanism:** After displaying the result for a few seconds, the system should reset and allow a new password entry.

## Submission Requirements:
Ensure that the GitHub repository contains:
1. **Tinkercad Simulation Link** showing the working circuit.
2. **Explanation of the Code** to describe how each part functions.
3. **Circuit Working Images** capturing different states of the system.
4. **Arduino Code** included in the repository.

## Hardware Components Required:
- Arduino UNO
- 4x4 Keypad
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Green LED
- Red LED
- 220Î© Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Expected Output:
- On correct password input, the LCD should display **"Access Granted"**, and the **Green LED should glow**.
- On incorrect password input, the LCD should display **"Access Denied"**, and the **Red LED should glow**.

**Ensure the repository is well-structured and all required components are included.** Happy coding! ðŸš€
